First up, you need to upgrade the firmware on you iMac4,1 to iMac5,1. The unzip this file in a location of your choice:<br>
https://github.com/jasoncopp/imac4-1-to-windows10x64/blob/master/bios-upgrade/iMac41-iMac51%20Firmware%20Tool.zip

The tool no longer works properly as the URL for the firmware has been updated; it gives "error 5530". However, here is a workaround from the above forum. It's pretty straightforward.

>STEP 3 - Run iMac41-iMac51 Firmware Tool

>Copy also the two downloaded .dmg from Apple: iMacEFIiMac41.dmg and iMacEFIiMac51.dmg

>STEP 5 - Lets do the Magic
>
>Open a terminal and drag and drop on it the ExtractAndPatchEFIFiles.sh script. Then run it and wait until everything finish
>Open a terminal, type sudo and then drag and drop the UpdateEFIiMac41-iMac51.sh script:
>sudo /Volumes/Ramdisk/UpdateEFIiMac41-iMac51.sh
>Then run it and wait until everything finishes (at the end it should report that return code is 0, which means that everything worked correctly).
>
>STEP 6 - Reboot

>Shutdown the iMac
>Turn it on and keep pressed power button until the iMac light ENDS blinking
>You will hear a BEEP sound
>The iMac will start the EFI update (a progress bar should be displayed)
>Wait the EFI update to complete andâ€¦.. Voila!

## Step 2 - Upgrade your CPU to a Core 2 Duo
I upgraded to a 2.0GHz T7200, which can be found on ebay for under $4. However, best performance is the T7600 which is a 2.33GHz CPU. This hardware upgrade is necessary to have a 64-bit CPU available for the operating system. Here's an ifixit link:

I do believe that you could get away without upgrading the CPU and sticking to a 32bit operating system. Windows is the only OS to have an up-to-date Chrome package available in 32-bit as of Feb 2020. I chose to go to 64-bit to future-proof the machine a bit.

## Step 3 - Partition your drive with Bootcamp.
Go into your installed MacOS and setup a bootcamp partition. You don't need your Windows install media or anything, just get the partition set up. It also sets up the emulated BIOS needed for windows to operate.

## Step 4 - 
Download Windows 7 Professional. I downloaded from the legal Internet Archive, where it can be found here:
